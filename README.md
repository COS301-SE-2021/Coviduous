**Coviduous** is a program that will be used to arrange and optimize office floor plans according to COVID-19 regulations in South Africa. This project aims to solve the issue of hand managing office capacity based on the country's alert level by making use of floor diagrams, desks and office space, ensuring the appropriate distance is maintained between workers who wish to return to the office. The application will allow booking and assignment of desks and office spaces for capacity management.

## Repository structure

Currently, our repository is structured as follows:

### Artificial intelligence

The artificial_intelligence directory currently contains the code for the AI our system interacts with, as well as the data it uses.

### Backend

The backend directory contains the functions we use as endpoints for communicating with the frontend over HTTP. These requests get sent into Firebase, and the responses are sent back to the frontend.

### Documentation

The documentation directory contains our architectural requirements, coding standards, installation manual, software requirements specification, and user manual documents, saved in a PDF format.

### Frontend

The frontend directory contains the code for our Flutter app. The Android, iOS and Web folders contain code generated by Flutter, which allows the app to run on multiple platforms. The assets folder contains images, documents and fonts used by the app. The lib folder contains our models, views and controllers (MVC). Finally, the test folder contains our tests.

### Workflows (.github)

The .github directory contains our repository's workflows for continuous integration.
