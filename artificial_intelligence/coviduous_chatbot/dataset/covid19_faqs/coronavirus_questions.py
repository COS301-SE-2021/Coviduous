        "Question": "What is COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion,  runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is self-isolation?",
     "Answer": "Self-isolation is a way to keep yourself from possibly infecting others if you think you might be infected. It involves limiting contact with public places, relatives, friends, colleagues, and public transport."
    },
    {
     "Question": "How does the virus spread?",
     "Answer": "COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Hand washing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?",
     "Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is contact tracing?",
     "Answer": "Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases. Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing?",
     "Answer": "If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with that they might have been exposed to COVID-19."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Who is considered a close contact of someone with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period (for example, three individual 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes)."
    },
    {
     "Question": "If I am a close contact, will I be tested for COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should be tested, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I go to work having been in close contact with someone with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Anyone who is sick or displaying symptoms should not go to school or work. If you have been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, you should self-isolate for 14 days from the date of close contact. If you are concerned, contact your medical practitioner for further advice."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is community spread?",
     "Answer": "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)? ",
     "Answer": "Multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious condition associated with COVID-19 where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. "
    },
    {
     "Question": "If I have COVID-19, how do I tell people that I was around them?",
     "Answer": "If you have COVID-19, tell your close contacts you have COVID-19 so that they can quarantine at home and get tested. By letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to COVID-19, you are helping to protect them and others within your community."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Does mask use help determine if someone is considered a close contact?",
     "Answer": "A person is still considered a close contact even if one or both people wore a mask when they were together."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals? ",
     "Answer": "Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?",
     "Answer": "Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I use hand sanitizer on pets?",
     "Answer": "Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it's COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is community mitigation?",
     "Answer": "Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What happens to people who get COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?",
        "Answer": "Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should I get a test for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?",
        "Answer": "Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is isolation?",
        "Answer": "Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is quarantine?",
        "Answer": "Quarantine is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do I need to retest before returning to work?",
        "Answer": "At present, re-testing people who have experienced mild illness, and have recovered from COVID-19 is not recommended. A person is considered safe to return to the workplace and discontinue self-isolation if they are no longer infectious. This means they developed their first symptoms more than 10 days prior and have not experienced any symptoms for at least 3 days (72 hours)."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is it a fact that after 10 days you can't transfer the virus anymore?",
        "Answer": "The most infectious period is thought to be 1 to 3 days before symptoms start, and in the first 7 days after symptoms begin. But some people may remain infectious for longer and this is because typically with viruses, the higher the viral load (the more virus circulating in the body), the higher the risk of transmission through known transmission pathways. So the more severe the illness and the higher the viral load, the longer you continue to shed the virus and are infectious."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should’nt I be tested negative first before returning to work?",
        "Answer": "People who have been self-quarantining, because they had contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and have completed their 10-day quarantine period without developing symptoms, can return to work on day 11. There is no requirement to be tested prior to returning to the work. It is, however, recommended they continue to practice social distancing and good hygiene as a precaution and wear a surgical mask."
    },
    {
        "Question": "My colleague tested positive for COVID-19, what must I do?",
        "Answer": "If you work closely in the same environment as a person with COVID-19, you will need to self-quarantine for 10 days because you have had high-risk exposure. High-risk exposure means you have had direct, close contact for more than 15 minutes with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, and you did not wear protective cloth face masks or you had physical contact or took other risks that could have exposed you to the COVID-19 virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What must I do if I have tested negative but the symptoms are still there?",
        "Answer": "A patient can have a false negative if they have very little virus up there or perhaps the specimen was taken inappropriately. It didn’t get up high enough to actually get to the place where the virus was located. If a patient presents with symptoms of COVID-19 — cough, fever, shortness of breath — but they test negative, they should consult their health practitioner for further assessment."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What role do masks play in the prevention of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Masks may help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by stopping the spread of respiratory droplets when people talk, sneeze or cough."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does a mask replace other prevention methods, like washing hands?",
        "Answer": "No, the 5 golden rules should be always be followed: wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water; do not touch your face with unwashed hands; cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue; keep 1,5 metres apart from other people (social distancing); stay at home if you are unwell."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should I use a cloth mask?",
        "Answer": "Cloth masks can be used when you are out in public. Like when you are travelling to work on public transport or doing shopping."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do I put the mask on and take it off?",
        "Answer": "Before putting on the mask: wash or sanitize your hands, place the mask against your face making sure it covers your nose and mouth. When wearing the mask: do not touch your face, do not fiddle with the mask, do not touch the mask with your hands,  remove the mask if it is damp or wet. When removing the mask: only touch the straps to remove the mask away from your face, put the mask in a container until you wash it or wash it immediately, wash or sanitize your hands after removing the mask. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I wear the same mask all day every day?",
        "Answer": "No, you will need 2 masks so that you can wash one and wear one. Wash your mask daily with soap and hot water. The mask is best dried in the sun and ironed. Do not share your mask with anyone."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do I have to wear a mask when I travel?",
        "Answer": "Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of a country."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can I protect myself from COVID-19 when using different types of transportation?",
        "Answer": "Maintaining physical distance to prevent COVID-19 is often difficult on public transportation conveyances. People may not be able to distance themselves by the recommended minimum of 6 feet from other people seated nearby or those standing in or passing through the aisles on airplanes, trains, or buses."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can travelling to visit family and friends increase my chances of getting and spreading COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes. CDC recommends delaying travel until you are fully vaccinated, because travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How long does it take to develop symptoms?",
        "Answer": "The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes. The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered is updated on a daily basis. At least 13 different vaccines (across 4 platforms) have been administered. Campaigns have started in 206 economies."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?",
        "Answer": "If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there treatments for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19. Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can adolescents catch COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19. While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, so far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can adolescents spread COVID-19 to other people even if they have mild or no symptoms?",
        "Answer": "Yes. Infected people in all age groups – including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill. The virus is spread from person to person through liquid particles such as aerosols (smaller) and droplets (larger) from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if someone in my family gets really ill with COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Immediately seek medical care if a member of your family gets seriously ill, for example develops difficulty breathing or feels pain or pressure in the chest. If possible, either you or an adult should contact your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out where and how you could get care."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if some of my friends are not sticking to the rules about physical distancing?",
        "Answer": "Explain to your friends why it is important to protect themselves and others by washing their hands, avoiding touching their face, always coughing or sneezing into their elbow, sleeve, or a tissue, and cooperating with physical distancing measures and movement restrictions when called on to do so. Maybe you can share ideas for fun virtual activities that your friends can participate in, and you can encourage them to do them together with you or with other friends."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I know there is a risk of getting COVID-19, but can I still play sports?",
        "Answer": "Yes. You can play sports that are in line with the physical distancing measures and movement restrictions that are in place in your country. If you are able to go for a bicycle ride, or if you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Schools are reopening in some areas of my country. Is it safe to  go back to school?",
        "Answer": "A decision to reopen schools in every country and area is made based on careful assessment of the situation, with consensus among all the key parties involved, including the health and education policy-makers, teachers and other school staff, parents and health and community workers. In addition, reopening of schools is carefully planned and prepared, with all necessary measures in place to protect the safety and health of everyone in the school community."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if I missed out on my education due to the COVID-19 pandemic?",
        "Answer": "Your school or place where you are studying are likely to make arrangements for you to catch up on what you have missed when your school was closed. Many schools have put in place accelerated learning modalities to help pupils catch up on learning loss. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should I wear a mask at school or when playing sports?",
        "Answer": "You should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise your breathing. However, remember to maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, limit the number of friends playing together, and respect hand hygiene."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When will this pandemic end so things can go back to normal?",
        "Answer": "We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends on every person’s contribution in helping stop the spread of the virus. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and by not going to school for a while, and other activities, are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through our communities."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What can we do so that other diseases like COVID-19 do not affect us in future?",
        "Answer": "To prevent the disastrous effects of emerging infectious diseases, we have to recognize that human health is intimately connected to the health of animals and our shared environment, and take action. Millions of young people have already mobilized to demand action not only on climate and biodiversity - but also for the right to breathe clean air, and for their future on a liveable planet."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is vaccination?",
        "Answer": "Vaccination is a safe and simple way to strengthen the immune system to build resistance against disease-causing germs. Once vaccinated, an individual will have a level of protection (or immunity), against that specific harmful disease. Vaccines contain a part of the virus/bacteria in a weakened, live or killed state, which will trigger a response from the immune system. It is important to be aware that vaccines do not cause disease or health complications."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do vaccines work?",
        "Answer": "A vaccine trains your immune system to recognise and combat viruses/bacteria. When exposed, antibodies are naturally produced by the immune system to fight the disease. If the bacteria or virus reappears, the immune system will remember how to respond and quickly destroy it."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How are vaccines administered?",
        "Answer": "Vaccines are mostly given through injection, but some are administered orally (by mouth) or sprayed into the nasal cavities."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is vaccination important?",
        "Answer": "Simply put, vaccination prevents disease and saves lives. It is a safe and effective way to protect oneself and those around you. Some individuals, for instance, those who suffer from a serious illness, are unable to take certain vaccines. These individuals depend on others to get vaccinated to reduce the spread of disease. Regular vaccination is needed to keep children healthy, prevent outbreaks and to eventually eradicate infectious diseases altogether."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why should I get vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "The reason is simple; if you get sick you could spread the disease to friends, family, and those most vulnerable around you."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there are multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Certain vaccines from some countries’ regulatory authorities have been approved for use and many more COVID-19 vaccines are currently being developed. Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) collaborates with global partners to ensure equal access to COVID-19 vaccines for the billions of people who will need it. Most COVID-19 vaccines being tested or reviewed require two doses."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should I get tested for COVID-19 before taking the vaccine?",
        "Answer": "No, you don’t need to test for COVID-19 infection before receiving the vaccine. If a person is feeling sick or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, it is better to wait for 30-days after recovery, or after a 10-day quarantine period has been completed."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I become resistant to the virus and its effects after having had it once?",
        "Answer": "Yes, a person can have good protection following a single infection. Immune responses are variable and some people develop better immunity than others. A person’s immunity is boosted every time they are exposed to the virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If I had a confirmed COVID-19 infection, should I be vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "Yes. There is good evidence to show that persons who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after infection will develop stronger immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. Evidence has shown that some people with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 do not develop strong antibody responses. Therefore vaccination after COVID-19 infection is a way to strengthen our immune responses and further reduce our chances of getting COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have just recovered from COVID-19, should I be vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "You should wait a minimum of 30 days after recovery to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can a SARS-COV-2 vaccine actually give me COVID-19 infection?",
        "Answer": "No. When a COVID-19 vaccine is injected into the shoulder muscle, the vaccine contains only a small part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ‘spike protein gene’. This piece of the gene cannot replicate (grow) on its own, nor can it cause damage to the lungs that an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes. It is biologically impossible for a vaccine to give a person COVID-19 infection."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why should you wait for 30-days post-COVID-19 recovery to be vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "The natural immune response to COVID-19 will be boosted through vaccination. Having at least 30-days between infection and vaccination would lead to an enhanced boosting of immunity."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do vaccines work from the first dose or do you need to get both?",
        "Answer": "The vaccine will start to work about two weeks after the first dose. And a person will get maximum protection following full vaccination, in other words, both doses."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are COVID-19 vaccines safe?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 vaccines are developed following the same legal requirements for quality, safety and efficacy as for all other vaccines. Like all vaccines, the effects of COVID-19 vaccines are tested first in the laboratory, including in animals, and then in human volunteers. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) evaluates COVID-19 vaccines against the same high standards as for all other vaccines before they are released for use."

    {
        "Question": "Are COVID-19 vaccines effective?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 vaccines are developed and authorised for use following the same legal requirements and high standards for quality, safety and efficacy as for all other vaccines. Prior to marketing authorisation, vaccine efficacy is assessed in clinical trials, establishing how well the vaccine works in preventing COVID-19 disease of any severity. Benefits of a vaccine may include preventing the disease in the first place, a reduction of the number of people infected, the number of severe cases of a disease as well as the number of deaths, and the severity of the disease if contracted."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do vaccinated individuals still need to follow personal protective measures?",
        "Answer": "At the early stages of vaccination campaigns it is not fully known to what extent fully vaccinated individuals will be protected from the disease in real-life conditions, how long they will be protected for, and what effect the vaccines will have on transmission. COVID-19 vaccines are proving to be effective at keeping people from becoming sick or seriously ill even if they do get COVID-19 disease. However, research is still ongoing on this topic, and more evidence is also needed about the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent transmission."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Will COVID-19 vaccines stop the pandemic?",
        "Answer": "Vaccines are a most powerful tool in ensuring public health, and COVID-19 vaccines can be expected to play an important role in contributing to control the pandemic. At this point, the pandemic is far from being over. In the first phases of vaccination campaigns, the main objective is to slow down the pandemic, protect those who are most at risk from severe disease, and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. More time is needed until a significant proportion of the EU population will have been vaccinated."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is COVID-19 vaccination still necessary, even after getting the disease and recovering?",
        "Answer": "Re-infection with COVID-19 occurs, although is relatively rare. Studies are ongoing, but at this point we do not know precisely how long people are naturally protected from getting COVID-19 again after clearing an infection. Early evidence suggests that such natural immunity from COVID-19 wanes over time and may not last very long. As a result, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended even for those who have recovered from the disease."

    {
        "Question": "Can COVID-19 be passed through breastfeeding?",
        "Answer": "Transmission of active COVID-19 (virus that can cause infection) through breast milk and breastfeeding has not been detected to date. There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the risk of infection in pregnant women and newborn babies?",
        "Answer": "Existing data indicate that pregnant women who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 experience similar illness and symptoms to non-pregnant women. Pregnant women who have diabetes and/or are obese may experience more severe disease. A limited number of cases have been reported with good overall outcomes and no severe illness for the newborn. All pregnant women should follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick and self-isolating in the event of symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there any treatment for COVID-19 disease?",
        "Answer": "The treatment for people who are hospitalised with severe COVID-19 disease is largely supportive (e.g. oxygen therapy, management of fluids), mostly using a symptomatic approach, targeting the symptoms rather than the virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can I avoid infecting others?",
        "Answer": "If you have any symptoms that are compatible with COVID-19, you should stay home and follow local recommendations on contacting your healthcare provider for advice about testing, isolation from others and medical care. Cough or sneeze into your elbow, or into a tissue. If you use a tissue, dispose of it carefully after a single use. Ensure you regularly clean your hands."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is physical distancing and why and how should I do it?",
        "Answer": "The term ‘physical distancing’ means the same as the widely-used term ‘social distancing’, but it more accurately describes what is intended, namely that people should keep a physical distance from one another. The success of physical distancing measures depends on ensuring that people maintain social contact from a distance with friends, family and colleagues. Internet-based communication and the phone are therefore key tools for ensuring a successful physical distancing strategy."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are face masks effective in protecting against COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "If you are infected, the use of medical face masks (generally pale blue in colour and available from pharmacies) may reduce the risk of you infecting others. Consider using a face mask when visiting busy, enclosed spaces where it is not possible to maintain sufficient physical distance from others, such as grocery stores and shopping centres, or when using public transport."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When and where should I be tested for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Anyone who develops symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested for the virus, wherever possible. Testing is also recommended, if possible, for people who do not have symptoms but who have been in close contact with a case of COVID-19. These tests are called ‘PCR’ (polymerase chain reaction) tests and are molecular tests that can detect the virus. They are usually conducted on samples collected from the throat or nose using a swab."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should children wear a mask?",
        "Answer": "Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What type of mask should children wear?",
        "Answer": "Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. This provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. The adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How should children wear a mask?",
        "Answer": "Children should be taught how to wear the mask properly, including not touching the front of the mask and not pulling it under the chin or into their mouth. They should store the mask in a bag or container, and not share the mask with others."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should a child wear a mask at home?",
        "Answer": "Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask, as long as they can tolerate it. The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should teachers or other adults working with children wear a mask?",
        "Answer": "In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others. This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should children wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities?",
        "Answer": "Children should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise their breathing. When organizing these activities for children, it is important to encourage all other critical public health measures: maintaining at least a 1-metre distance from others, limiting the number of children playing together, providing access to hand hygiene facilities and encouraging their use. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there alternatives to fabric masks such as face shields?",
        "Answer": "In the context of COVID-19, some children may not be able to wear a mask due to disabilities or specific situations such as speech classes where the teacher needs to see their mouths. In these cases, face shields may be considered an alternative to masks, but they do not provide the equivalent protection in keeping the virus from being transmitted to others."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the recommended practices once back home after outdoor activities?",
        "Answer": "Thorough hand hygiene: washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand gel, should be performed before touching surfaces, items, pets, and people within the household environment."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How should I clean food items from the grocery store or packaged items?",
        "Answer": "There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply. The COVID-19 virus is generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of the COVID-19 virus associated with food."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can contact tracing help in controlling spread of the virus?",
        "Answer": "Yes. Contact tracing is an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks, such as those caused bythe COVID-19 virus. Contact tracing can break the chains of transmission through the rapid identification, isolation and clinical care of cases, and providing supported quarantine of contacts, meaning that virus transmission can be stopped."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does contact tracing still work against new variants of the COVID-19 virus?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the principles of contact tracing remain the same for newly identified variants of the COVID-19 virus. While some of the variants of the virus are more transmissible, thorough and timely contact tracing and supported quarantine of contacts is even more important to control the spread of the virus. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do I manage quarantine and how do I take care of myself during quarantine?",
        "Answer": "WHO recommends supported quarantine for 14 days from the last contact with a confirmed case to minimize risk of infecting others. You should remain separated from others in the household for the duration of quarantine. If you cannot be in a separate room, stay at least one metre away from others, the farther the better. Make sure you have enough foodand water, and a way to communicate with others."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can COVID-19 be transmitted at the workplace?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces. Exposure can occur at the workplace, while travelling to work, during work-related travel to an area with local community transmission, as well as on the way to and from the workplace."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the workplace?",
        "Answer": "The risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace depends on the likelihood of coming within 1 metre of others, in having frequent physical contact with people who may be infected with COVID-19, and through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who should carry out the workplace risk assessment?",
        "Answer": "Employers and managers, in consultation with workers, should carry out and regularly update the risk assessment for work-related exposure to COVID-19, preferably with the support of occupational health services."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can workplaces plan for the prevention and mitigation of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Workplaces should develop action plans to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 as part of the business continuity plan and according to the results of the risk assessments and the epidemiological situation. The action plan and preventive measures should be regularly monitored and updated. Workers and their representatives should be consulted and should participate in the development, monitoring and updating of the workplace COVID-19.Workplaces should develop action plans to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 as part of the business continuity plan and according to the results of the risk assessments and the epidemiological situation.

        "Question": "Should I travel during the pandemic?",
        "Answer": "If you are in a high-risk group for severe COVID-19 but have not been fully vaccinated and do not have immunity from a recent previous COVID-19 infection, consider postponing travel to areas where COVID-19 is widespread."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What precautions should I take during travel?",
        "Answer": "Wherever you are, follow COVID-19 prevention measures, such as wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, maintaining physical distance of at least 1 metre, and avoiding crowded or poorly ventilated places and settings whenever possible. Traveling may place you in areas that are closed, confined, or crowded (the three Cs), which puts you at a higher risk of being exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. Whenever possible, stay in open, well-ventilated settings."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who should not travel?",
        "Answer": "People with symptoms of COVID-19 – including fever, cough, or shortness of breath – should not travel.  If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, stay home and isolate yourself away from other people. If you have been around someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, isolate yourself, follow the guidance of local authorities and watch for symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is meant by “essential travel”?",
        "Answer": "As part of public health efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, travel may be limited or restricted to travel deemed to be essential. Essential travel is defined differently by national authorities in different countries. It may include travel for emergencies and humanitarian activities (including emergency medical flights and medical evacuation)."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should I get a vaccine or immunity certificate before travelling?",
        "Answer": "Before you travel, know the requirements and policies in place where your trip originates and at your destination. Every country has its own rules. Some countries exempt travelers who have been fully vaccinated or have proof of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection from certain requirements, such as testing and/or quarantine."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should I get a COVID-19 test before departure or upon arrival?",
        "Answer": "Know before you go. Some venues, destinations and countries require COVID-19 tests prior to departure or upon arrival as part of their strategies to prevent the spread of disease. COVID-19 tests conducted immediately prior to departure or on arrival are used in an effort to determine the health status of travellers."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What happens if I have symptoms while traveling or when I arrive at my destination?",
        "Answer": "If you have any symptoms of COVID-19 while you travel or when you arrive at your destination, notify health authorities immediately and follow their guidance. You may be required to quarantine or isolate yourself. Your travel companions may also be required to quarantine, since they have been in contact with you."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if I get sick while traveling?",
        "Answer": "If you become ill during your travel, inform your travel attendant (plane, ship, train, etc.). You may be moved to a seat farther away from others. Wear a mask continuously while you travel, frequently clean your hands with hand sanitizer, cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and maintain at least a 1 metre distance from others wherever possible. You should stop travelling as soon as feasible."
    },
    {
        "Question": "So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub."

    {
        "Question": "How do I know if I’m a contact? What should I do if I am?",
        "Answer": "If you think you may be a contact of someone who has recently been infected, you should be contacted by health authorities to determine if you meet the contact definition. You may also be informed directly by someone you were in contact with who later tested positive. If you have downloaded a COVID-19 proximity tracing application, you may also get notified through your mobile phone."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is quarantine? And how is it different from isolation?",
        "Answer": "Quarantine is the separation of contacts from others after exposure to a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case – you may or may not be infected. Isolation is the separation of people who are known to be infected with the COVID-19 virusfrom other who are not infected. Both quarantine and isolation help to stop the spread of the virus."

    {
        "Question": "What can I do as an individual to support contact tracing measures in my community?",
        "Answer": "Everyone has a part to play to bring COVID-19 under control, and contact tracing begins with informed, engaged and enabled communities. Understand the local public health and social measures and collaborate with health authorities for case and contact investigation. Agree to monitoring, report signs or symptoms of COVID-19 promptly, and be prepared to quarantine or go into isolation if you become a confirmedcase of COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What causes a virus to change to a new variant?",
        "Answer": "When a virus is widely circulating in a population and causing many infections, the likelihood of the virus mutating increases. The more opportunities a virus has to spread, the more it replicates – and the more opportunities it has to undergo changes."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What impact do the new variants of the COVID-19 virus have on vaccines?",
        "Answer": "The COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in development or have been approved are expected to provide at least some protection against new virus variants because these vaccines elicit a broad immune response involving a range of antibodies and cells. Therefore, changes or mutations in the virus should not make vaccines completely ineffective."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can we prevent future new variants of the COVID-19 virus?",
        "Answer": "Stopping the spread at the source remains key. Current measures to reduce transmission – including frequent hand washing, wearing a mask, physical distancing, good ventilation and avoiding crowded places or closed settings – continue to work against new variants by reducing the amount of viral transmission and therefore also reducing opportunities for the virus to mutate."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is it important to get vaccinated even if there are new variants of the virus?",
        "Answer": "Vaccines are a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19, and there are clear public health and lifesaving benefits to using the tools we already have. We must not put off getting vaccinated because of our concerns about new variants, and we must proceed with vaccination even if the vaccines may be somewhat less effective against some of the COVID-19 virus variants. We need to use the tools we have in hand even while we continue to improve those tools. We are all safe only if everyone is safe."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there a new variant of the COVID-19 virus?",
        "Answer": "A new variant has emerged in the United Kingdom with an unusually large number of mutations. It was first detected in September 2020 and is now highly prevalent in London and southeast England. In South Africa, another variant has emerged independently of the variant detected in the United Kingdom. This variant, originally detected in October, shares some mutations with the variant detected in the United Kingdom. Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented globally during this pandemic. Most variants do not change how the virus behaves and many disappear."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are these variants more contagious?",
        "Answer": "Based on the information we have from health centres right now, these variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than previous strains and could increase the overall spread of the virus that causes COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do these variants cause more severe disease?",
        "Answer": "Currently, there is no evidence that these variants cause more severe illness or increased risk of death than previous circulating strains.  However, a higher rate of transmission could lead to more cases, which would increase the number of people who need clinical care."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What measures are necessary to prevent the spread of these new variants?",
        "Answer": "The most effective ways to prevent the spread of this virus, no matter the strain, remain the same as have been previously stressed by public health experts.  That means wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet apart from others, avoiding crowds, ventilating indoor spaces, and washing hands frequently are the most effective tools to slow the spread of this virus, no matter the strain. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are these new variant strains some kind of new super virus?",
        "Answer": "No. Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time.  Sometimes new variants emerge and disappear quickly.  Other times, new variants emerge and start infecting people.  Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been documented in the United States and globally during this pandemic."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for people living with HIV?",
        "Answer": "Many of the COVID-19 vaccines studies have included a small number of people living with HIV in their trials. Despite limited data, available information suggests current WHO recommended COVID-19 vaccines ( AstraZeneca/Oxford, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer/BionTech, Sinopharm and Sinovac) are safe for people living with HIV. The currently available vaccine products are not live vaccines, they include genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 which cannot replicate."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do COVID-19 vaccines provide protection for people living with HIV?",
        "Answer": "It is theoretically possible that people living with HIV with low CD4 cell counts might have a weaker immune response to vaccines. However, in practice this has not been documented for all vaccines and there is no evidence to support a less robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccines among people living with HIV and low CD4 cell counts."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I get sick with COVID-19 through contact with urine, feces or sewage?",
        "Answer": "While fragments of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) have been detected in the urine or feces of some patients, there have been no reports to date of transmission of COVID-19 through urine or faeces. It remains important to protect yourself with personal protective equipment whenever contact with bodily fluids may occur and to clean your hands frequently."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I get sick with COVID-19 from swimming in the sea, rivers, lakes or swimming pools?",
        "Answer": "Available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not spread from water. Natural bodies of water and swimming pools do not appear to pose a risk for COVID-19 transmission even if polluted by faeces or wastewater. Pools are usually treated regularly to prevent contamination with a range of pathogens which could be present."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I get sick with COVID-19 from drinking water?",
        "Answer": "The risk coronaviruses pose to drinking water is considered to be low and SARS-CoV-2 virus has not been detected in drinking water supplies. Drinking water treatment methods neutralize infectious pathogens present in the water. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, which means it has a fragile fatty envelope that is easily destroyed by the treatment process. Therefore, treated drinking water does not pose a risk for COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can food businesses remain safe from virus contamination?",
        "Answer": "The main priority is to keep the virus out of the food environment. Several key measures are required including upgrading of cleaning and sanitation measures, disinfecting surfaces and high-touch points, educating staff on the virus and how to protect themselves and others, reinforcing protocols such as physical distancing, hand washing, and improved security with people staying in their vehicles/sanitizing hands when handing out documents and other material."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should grocery store workers wear gloves and masks?",
        "Answer": "Gloves may be used by food workers but must be changed frequently and hands must be washed between glove changes and when gloves are removed. Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Face Masks do not have to be routinely used by food workers to protect against transmission of COVID-19. However, for some food processing activities, such as working in abattoirs or handling cooked, ready-to-eat foods, wearing face masks is a usual practice."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the protocol when an employee working in a food business becomes ill with COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Staff who are feeling unwell should not report to work and should seek medical advice. However, in the event that a food worker becomes unwell in the workplace with typical symptoms of COVID-19, they should be removed to an area away from other people. If possible, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. Arrangements should be made for the unwell employee to be removed quickly from the food premise."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When can an employee return to work following illness? Are temperature checks appropriate?",
        "Answer": "A return to work policy for staff who have been infected and recovered from COVID-19 should be in place. WHO recommends that a confirmed patient could be released from isolation once their symptoms resolve and they have two negative PCR tests at least 24 hours apart.  If testing is not possible, WHO recommends that a confirmed patient can be released from isolation 14 days after symptoms resolve. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "What specific precautions do food workers need to take?",
        "Answer": "Physical distancing, good personal hygiene with frequent hand washing, and application of general food hygiene measures are the most important precautions food workers should adopt. Physical distancing is very important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. This is achieved by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals. Frequent hand washing with soap and water and use of hand sanitizers are also important in reducing the risk of transmission. "

    {
        "Question": "What is the plan of the Department of Basic Education, what should we do as teachers?",
        "Answer": "Protocols have been developed and distributed to provinces and districts in the country. However, it is especially important to encourage children and staff to take every day preventative actions to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses. This includes staying at home when sick, washing hands with soap and water or using an alcohol based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol and cleaning frequently touched surfaces. If children do become ill, they should be strictly isolated at home. In situations where the child or staff member becomes sick at school, they should be separated from healthy students and staff until sick students and staff can be sent home."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can the virus spread through food items?",
        "Answer": "The Coronaviruses is spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always rinse the food with water and wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I get the virus through handling or receiving packages or products?",
        "Answer": "It is possible that one may touch the SARS-CoV-2 virus while handling packages contaminated by the virus however, one may only contract the virus or be affected by it when the virus comes into contact with your mucosal membranes (mouth, tongue or nose) thus entering your body. This is not the main means of transmission. Inhaling respiratory droplets is the main way the virus spreads."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does warm weather kill the virus?",
        "Answer": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus does not survive well in warmer climates. It is therefore expected to thrive in the colder winter seasons."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if I am at higher risk of getting the virus?",
        "Answer": "If you are at higher risk of getting the virus, you should take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others. When you go out, try to avoid unnecessary contact, non-essential travel and exposure to others who are sick. Wash your hands often, avoid crowds and if there is an outbreak in your community, consider staying home and limiting contact to essential people."
    }, 
    {
        "Question": "How long does the virus survive on surfaces?",
        "Answer": "It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What role can I play in the fight against the virus?",
        "Answer": "Be aware of fake news reporting, ensuring credible resources from the WHO, CDC or NICD are only shared.

    },
    {
        "Question": "Does the long term wearing of masks have any negative impact on one’s health?",
        "Answer": "Prolonged use of any face mask has not been shown to cause carbon dioxide toxicity or lack of adequate oxygen in healthy people. Healthcare workers routinely wear masks for prolonged periods while performing their duties. Cloth masks provide an additional layer of protection by reducing the number of microorganisms that a person releases into the air. Mass mask wearing will ensure that fewer potential viral droplets are released into the air.Wearing amask reduces the risk that someone will be exposed to the virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why must bodies be wrapped in plastic bags?",
        "Answer": "The human remains of a person who has died from coronavirus are considered contagious and should be kept only in designated mortuaries. Under no circumstances shall the human remains be directly handled, whether for aesthetic, hygiene preparations, cultural or religious reasons. Human remains shall be placed in transparent leak proof double body bags and sealed."

        "Question": "Can COVID-19 be transmitted at the workplace?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces. Exposure can occur at the workplace, while travelling to work, during work-related travel to an area with local community transmission, as well as on the way to and from the workplace."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the workplace?",
        "Answer": "The risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace depends on the likelihood of coming within 1 metre of others, in having frequent physical contact with people who may be infected with COVID-19, and through contact with contaminated surfaces and objects."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who should carry out the workplace risk assessment?",
        "Answer": "Employers and managers, in consultation with workers, should carry out and regularly update the risk assessment for work-related exposure to COVID-19, preferably with the support of occupational health services."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the key considerations for the workplace risk assessment?",
        "Answer": "For each risk assessment, consider the environment, the task, the threat, resources available, such as personal protective equipment, and the feasibility of protective measures. The risk assessment should also extend to collective accommodation provided by the employer for workers, such as dormitories.  Essential public services, such as security and police, food retail, accommodation, public transport, deliveries, water and sanitation, and other frontline workers may be at an increased risk of exposure to occupational hazards for health and safety."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What key measures to protect against COVID-19 should be undertaken in all workplaces?",
        "Answer": "Measures to prevent transmission of COVID-19 that apply to all workplaces and all people at the workplace include frequent hand-washing or disinfection with alcohol based hand sanitizer, respiratory hygiene such as covering coughs, physical distancing of at least 1 metre or more according to the national recommendations, wearing of masks where distancing is not possible, regular environmental cleaning and disinfection, and limiting unnecessary travel. Clear policies and messages, training, and education for staff and managers to increase awareness of COVID-19 are essential."
    }, 
    {
        "Question": "What additional measures should be taken at workplaces and for jobs at high risk?",

    },
    {
        "Question": "What should be taken into consideration when setting a physical distance at the workplace?",
        "Answer": "WHO recommends keeping a physical distance of at least 1 metre between each person in all settings, including in workplaces. Because transmission can occur in crowded workplaces, WHO recommends providing sufficient space, at least 10 square meters, for every worker. National recommendations for physical distancing may require greater physical distance and should be complied with."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can workplaces plan for the prevention and mitigation of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Workplaces should develop action plans to prevent and mitigate COVID-19 as part of the business continuity plan and according to the results of the risk assessments and the epidemiological situation. The action plan and preventive measures should be regularly monitored and updated. Workers and their representatives should be consulted and should participate in the development, monitoring and updating of the workplace COVID-19. It is very important to monitor the effectiveness of preventive measures, and the compliance of workers, visitors, customers, clients and sub-contractors with the measures."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can the return to the workplace be immediate after public measures are lifted?",
        "Answer": "The return to work premises should be carefully planned ahead, with preventive measures put in place according to the risk assessment of the different jobs and work tasks. All possible risks for safety and health should be assessed, such as risks resulting from reduced maintenance of machines and facilities during the closure period.  If a return to work is rushed and not done in a phased and cautious manner, it puts lives at risk, and threatens to undermine efforts to restore social and economic activity."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What mental health and psychosocial support should be provided to workers during COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 is associated with a range of concerns, such as fear of falling ill and dying, of being socially excluded, placed in quarantine, or losing a livelihood. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common reactions for people in the context of COVID-19. Mental health and psychosocial support should be made available to all workers. Comprehensive risk assessments can help identify and mitigate related occupational hazards for mental health."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What do we know about immunity from COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Most people who are infected with COVID-19 develop an immune response within the first few weeks after infection. Research is still ongoing into how strong that protection is and how long it lasts. WHO is also looking into whether the strength and length of immune response depends on the type of infection a person has: without symptoms (‘asymptomatic’), mild or severe. Even people without symptoms seem to develop an immune response."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does COVID-19 spread between people?",
        "Answer": "We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When do infected people transmit the virus?",
        "Answer": "Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people. Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer. While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic?",
        "Answer": "Both terms refer to people who do not have symptoms. The difference is that ‘asymptomatic’ refers to people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while ‘pre-symptomatic’ refers to infected people who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there certain settings where COVID-19 can spread more easily?",
        "Answer": "Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can I reduce my risk of getting COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people infected with COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants. Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. If you can, carry alcohol-based rub with you and use it often. Cover your coughs and sneezes with a bent elbow or tissue, throwing used tissues into a closed bin right away. Then wash your hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub. Get vaccinated: When it’s your turn, get vaccinated. Follow local guidance and recommendations about vaccination."

        "Question": "Why should people wear masks?",
        "Answer": "Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more. Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should masks be worn by the general public?",
        "Answer": "In areas where the virus is circulating, masks should be worn when you’re in crowded settings, where you can’t be at least 1 metre from others, and in rooms with poor or unknown ventilation. It’s not always easy to determine the quality of ventilation, which depends on the rate of air change, recirculation and outdoor fresh air. So if you have any doubts, it’s safer to simply wear a mask."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should I wear a mask while exercising?",
        "Answer": "Even when you’re in an area of COVID-19 transmission, masks should not be worn during vigorous physical activity because of the risk of reducing your breathing capacity. No matter how intensely you exercise, keep at least 1 metre away from others, and if you’re indoors, make sure there is adequate ventilation."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do I choose what fabric mask to buy, or ideal fit and fabrics if I make my own?",
        "Answer": "Check for filtration, breathability and fit when choosing a fabric mask. It should be held in place comfortably with little adjustment using elastic bands or ties. There are different mask shapes such as flat-fold or duckbill – find the one that fits closely over your nose, cheeks and chin. When the edges of the mask are not close to the face and shift, such as when speaking, air penetrates through the edges of the mask rather than being filtered through the fabric. Masks with vents or exhalation valves are not advised because they allow unfiltered breath to escape the mask."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should health workers wear masks in the context of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Health workers are the most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 because they are in close contact with patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19. In areas of community or cluster transmission, health workers, caregivers and visitors should wear a mask at all times when in the health facility, even if physical distancing can be maintained. Masks should be worn throughout their shifts, apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?",
        "Answer": "High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should event organizers provide COVID-19 testing?",
        "Answer": "No, testing should be conducted in accordance with local health providers and national guidance.  Anyone unwell or symptomatic should not be allowed to participate in the event. Establish close collaboration with local public health authorities well before the event, to facilitate testing for athletes, officials or spectators who meet pre-agreed suspect cases definitions. Consider host-country health service capacity to manage any COVID-19 activity, and other public health issues happening at the event over and above its own national pandemic response."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the risks arising from public transport to the venue(s)?",
        "Answer": "The extra risk from participants and spectators travelling on public transport in a major city may not be significant compared to the ongoing risk to the local population using the transport all the time if physical distancing is not possible on public transport."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does the presence of antibodies mean that a person is immune?",
        "Answer": "There are many studies underway to better understand the antibody response following infection to SARS-CoV-2.  Several studies to date show that most people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop antibodies specific to this virus. However, the levels of these antibodies can vary between those who have severe disease (higher levels of antibodies) and those with milder disease or asymptomatic infection (lower levels of antibodies). Many studies are underway to better understand the levels of antibodies that are needed for protection, and how long these antibodies last."
    }, 
    {
        "Question": "Can people who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection be re-infected?",
        "Answer": "To date, there are some reports of individuals who have been reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.  There are likely to be more examples of reinfection reported and scientists are working to understand the role of the immune response in the first and second infection. WHO is working with scientists to understand each occurrence of reinfection and the antibody response during the first and subsequent infections."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?",
        "Answer": "Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death. Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?",
        "Answer": "The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?",
        "Answer": "While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.  In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection. "

    {
        "Question": "So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do I stay active in and around the home?",
        "Answer": "Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting, whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes. Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What precautions should everyone take in a hotel or other accommodation establishment?",
        "Answer": "Wash all parts of your hands frequently (at least 20 seconds if using an alcohol-based hand rub, and at least 40 seconds with soap and water), including after exchanging objects such as money or credit cards; look for hand sanitizer stations and use them before going into dining halls, restaurants or bars; cover a cough or sneeze with a bent elbow or tissue, and throw away the tissue in a closed bin; maintain at least a 1 metre distance from staff and other guests. This includes avoiding hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If you can’t guarantee the distance, wear a mask. Be sure to check local and national guidelines on the use of masks."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are pools and water areas safe to use?",
        "Answer": "Gym, beach, swimming pool, spa, sauna and steam bath facilities can be used safely with certain restrictions, as determined by national guidelines."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there precautions to take while eating in a restaurant?",
        "Answer": "There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted by food, including fresh fruits and vegetables. The virus can be killed while cooking food at temperatures of at least 70°C. Food buffets are not recommended because of the risk of close physical contact with others, shared serving implements and multiple people touching the surfaces on the buffet."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can you get the virus from people who were in the room previous to you?",
        "Answer": "Hotels and other accommodations should have procedures for cleaning, disinfecting and ventilating the room properly between every guest’s stay. These processes allow the accommodations to be used immediately afterward. If these procedures are followed, there is no need to leave the room empty between guests."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should travellers do if they get sick while at an accommodation facility?",
        "Answer": "If a guest develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should notify the facility manager and seek medical advice by contacting local health authorities. The guest should isolate from others, including fellow travellers. If the guest cannot be isolated or staff need to enter the room, the ill person should put on a medical mask, and people nearby should also wear a mask.  If the medical mask cannot be tolerated by the ill person, then he or she should cough or sneeze into a bent elbow or use tissues to cover the mouth, and discard the tissue immediately into a closed waste bag."
    },
    {
        "Question": "As safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 are approved, who should be the first to receive them?",
        "Answer": "WHO believes that everyone, everywhere who could benefit from safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines should have access as quickly as possible, starting with those at highest risk of serious disease or death."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who should participate in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines?",
        "Answer": "Small (phase I) safety studies of COVID-19 vaccines should enroll healthy adult volunteers. Larger (phase II and III) Studies should include volunteers that reflect the populations for whom the vaccines are intended. This means enrolling people from diverse geographic areas, racial and ethnic backgrounds, genders, and ages, as well as those with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19. Including these groups in clinical trials is the only way to make sure that a vaccine will be safe and effective for everyone who needs it. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do I volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial?",
        "Answer": "Opportunities to volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial vary from country to country. If you are interested in volunteering, check with local health officials or research institutions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for people living with HIV?",
        "Answer": "Many of the most advanced vaccines have included a small number of people living with HIV. Despite limited data, available information suggests COVID-19 vaccines for which WHO has issued recommendations, are safe for people living with HIV. The vaccines often include genetic material from SARS-CoV-2, but do not contain the whole virus, so the virus cannot replicate. As they are not live vaccines, they are not expected to be less safe in people who are immunocompromised."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do COVID-19 vaccines provide protection for people living with HIV?",
        "Answer": "It is theoretically possible that people living with HIV with low CD4 cell counts might have a weaker immune response to a vaccine. However, in practice this has not been documented for other vaccines and there is no evidence to support a less robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccines among people with low CD4 cell counts. WHO is reviewing new evidence as it emerges and will provide an update when needed.  It is important to advocate for the inclusion of people living with HIV, including those with more advanced disease, in vaccine trials to provide information to confirm efficacy."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should people living with HIV get vaccines early in the roll out?",
        "Answer": "Most countries have made clear plans to support arrangements for those who will receive the vaccine in order of priority based on their age, health, occupation and other factors such people in living in care or residential homes. Some countries are prioritising vaccination for people living with HIV or who are immunocompromised."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What can people living with HIV do today to support their health?",
        "Answer": "While the world works towards ensuring fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, it is important to continue the essential public health actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Alongside the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to maintain access to essential health services. This includes supporting people living with HIV to be able to continue anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and adapting services to make this easier and more efficient during the COVID-19 response."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do we know that COVID-19 vaccines are safe?",
        "Answer": "There are strict protections in place to help ensure the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines. Before receiving validation from WHO and national regulatory agencies, COVID-19 vaccines must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and efficacy."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines?",
        "Answer": "Like any vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild, short term side effects, such as a low-grade fever or pain or redness at the injection site. Most reactions to vaccines are mild and go away within a few days on their own. More serious or long-lasting side effects to vaccines are possible but extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored for as long as they are in use, to detect rare adverse events and implement approaches to limit their occurrence. "
    }, 
    {
        "Question": "What is the link between COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions?",
        "Answer": "Severe allergic reactions have occurred rarely to some of the COVID vaccines. A severe allergic reaction – such as anaphylaxis – is a potential but rare side effect with any vaccine. In persons with a known risk, such as previous experience of an allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or any of the known components in the vaccine, precautions may need to be taken. WHO recommends that healthcare providers assess the risk for severe allergic reactions prior to giving a COVID-19 vaccine by inquiring about previous reactions or known allergies to any components in the vaccine."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What happens if an adverse event is reported?",
        "Answer": "As with any vaccine, it is essential to closely monitor the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that are used in immunization programmes. If a health problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation should take place by the public health programme in the country."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Under what circumstances should a COVID-19 vaccine be recalled?",
        "Answer": "Vaccine recalls or withdrawals due to safety issues are rare. Recalls are usually initiated voluntarily by a vaccine manufacturer before any adverse events are reported. For example, ongoing monitoring of vaccine production may show that an irregularity has caused a batch of vaccines to lose their strength. In this case, people who have received a vaccine from that batch may need to be vaccinated again to ensure they are protected."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is it possible that someone vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get infected?",
        "Answer": "While COVID-19 vaccines have high levels of efficacy, especially against hospitalization and severe disease, no vaccine is 100% protective. As a result, there will be some small percentage of vaccinated people who fall ill with COVID-19 in spite of being vaccinated. In addition to a vaccine's specific characteristics, several factors such as a person's age, their underlying health conditions, previous COVID-19 disease, current exposure to SARS-CoV-2, or the circulation of virus variants may have an impact on a vaccine’s effectiveness. We do not yet know how long immunity from different COVID-19 vaccines will last. That is one reason why, even as COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out, we must continue using all public health measures that work to decrease exposure risk, such as physical distancing, masks, and handwashing."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who should be excluded from receiving COVID-19 vaccines?",
        "Answer": "Medical professionals can best advise individuals on whether or not you should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. There are very few conditions that would exclude someone from being vaccinated. Based on available evidence, people with a history of severe allergic reactions to any ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine should generally be excluded from COVID-19 vaccination in order to avoid possible adverse effects."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How will WHO ensure vaccine safety monitoring and response when COVID-19 vaccines are used?",
        "Answer": "Vaccine safety monitoring is ensured at the national, regional, and global level. As is standard practice in all national immunization programmes, WHO supports the set up of safety monitoring systems for COVID-19 vaccines in every country. After a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced in a country, WHO works with vaccine manufacturers, health officials and other partners to monitor for any safety concerns on an ongoing basis. Specific safety concerns that may arise are evaluated by WHO and an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS) in conjunction with the relevant national authorities."

    {
        "Question": "Can someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 be cared for at home?",
        "Answer": "People with no symptoms should be able to stay at home, if adequately isolated from others, but this should be confirmed by a doctor. Those with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if they are under the age of 60, do not smoke, are not obese, and do not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should be done to prevent other people in the house from becoming sick if a person with COVID-19 is being cared for at home?",
        "Answer": "The ill person should stay in a separate room. If this is not possible, then keep at least a 1-metre distance from them. The sick person and anyone else in the same room should wear a medical mask; rovide good ventilation in the room of the ill person and shared spaces, and open windows if possible and safe to do so; The ill person should wear a medical mask as much as possible, in particular when not alone in the room and when at least a 1-metre distance from others cannot be maintained; Visitors should not be allowed in the home."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How long should people with COVID-19 stay at home and in isolation?",
        "Answer": "Those with symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after the first day they developed symptoms, plus another 3 days after the end of symptoms – when they are without fever and without respiratory symptoms; People without symptoms should stay isolated for a minimum of 10 days after testing positive."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should a patient with COVID-19 be cared for at home?",
        "Answer": "Ideally, all patients with COVID-19 are cared for in a healthcare facility. However, there may be some circumstances where patients may not require hospitalization or inpatient care is unavailable or unsafe, such as when capacity is insufficient to meet the demand for healthcare services. Patients should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the health worker to determine where their care needs can best be met."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What factors determine whether a COVID-19 patient can be cared for at home?",
        "Answer": "Patients with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, and if the patient is under the age of 60, does not smoke, is not obese, and does not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What additional factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the home setting to determine if it is safe for patients and families to remain at home?",
        "Answer": "There are a number of environmental and social factors to consider for patients to safely remain at home with their families or household members. An overall needs assessment of the patient and family that includes the availability of trained health workers for support should be conducted."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What precautions should health workers take when providing care to patients in home settings?",
        "Answer": "Perform a risk assessment to select the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a medical mask, eye protection, gloves and gown when caring for the patient; Provide instructions to caregivers and household members on cleaning and disinfection in the home, and on management of waste, laundry and utensils related to the patient."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Could pregnant women be cared for at home if they have COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Pregnant women with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they do not smoke, are not obese, and do not have other diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can children be cared for at home if they have COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Children should be kept together with their parents or caregivers wherever possible. Children with mild or moderate disease can be considered for home care if the home setting is suitable for the isolation and care of a COVID-19 patient, if they are not obese, do not smoke, and do not have other conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or immunosuppression."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How does COVID-19 spread between people?",
        "Answer": "We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways; The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When do infected people transmit the virus?",
        "Answer": "Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people; Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the difference between people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic? Don’t they both mean someone without symptoms?",
        "Answer": "Both terms refer to people who do not have symptoms. The difference is that ‘asymptomatic’ refers to people who are infected but never develop any symptoms, while ‘pre-symptomatic’ refers to infected people who have not yet developed symptoms but go on to develop symptoms later. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there certain settings where COVID-19 can spread more easily?",
        "Answer": "Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can I reduce my risk of getting COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Follow local guidance: Check to see what national, regional and local authorities are advising so you have the most relevant information for where you are; Keep your distance: Stay at least 1 metre away from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick, since people can have the virus without having symptoms; Wear a mask:  Wear a well-fitting three-layer mask, especially when you can’t physically distance, or if you’re indoors. Clean your hands before putting on and taking off a mask; Avoid crowded places, poorly ventilated, indoor locations and avoid prolonged contact with others. Spend more time outdoors than indoors."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does WHO recommend the use of gloves in the community to prevent transmission of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "No, WHO does not advise using gloves by people in the community. Instead, WHO encourages the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit of public places, such as supermarkets or public/private buildings. This helps reduce germs brought in by people’s hands. By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus and other infections."

However, some people with coronavirus disease may worsen at home and need admission to hospital. It is very important that you carefully monitor your symptoms throughout your illness and look out for emergency warning signs.Emergency warning signs include: trouble breathing, chest pain or pressure in your chest that does not go away, coughing up blood, becoming confused, severe sleepiness, blue lips or face.  If you have any warning signs, you or a member of your household should call your nearest hospital or emergency services immediately and notify them that you have confirmed coronavirus disease."

        "Question": "body fight coronavirus disease on its own without suffering side effects of coronavirus vaccine?",
        "Answer": "Evidence shows that your body’s response when you are sick from COVID-19 is much weaker and shorter than the response to the vaccine. Getting the vaccine will give you a much stronger and longer-lasting immune response. The side effects of the vaccine are mild and do not last more than a day or two, while getting sick from COVID-19 can cause hospitalisation or death."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why time between two doses of Pfizer extended?",
        "Answer": "The time between the Pfizer doses was extended because there is now evidence that if you get the second dose 42 days after the first dose, your body’s response is much stronger and lasts longer than when the time is shorter."

    {
        "Question": "people with chronic diseases high blood pressure get the coronavirus vaccine?",
        "Answer": "People with chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes are at higher risk of getting severe COVID-19. Therefore, they will benefit the most from getting the vaccine. They should also make sure that their condition is controlled, go for regular check-ups with their healthcare practitioner and take their chronic medication. If you are unsure about your condition, consult with your healthcare practitioner."

    {
        "Question": "How dangerous allergic reaction to COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine?",
        "Answer": "Severe allergic reactions to the vaccine are very rare. An allergic reaction usually happens within seconds or minutes after getting the vaccine. This is why ALL people must wait in the observation area for 15 minutes after getting the vaccine to make sure they do not have a major allergic reaction."
    },
    {
        "Question": "people with allergies, who should not get COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine?",
        "Answer": "Anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in the vaccine.Anyone who is allergic to polyethene glycol (PEG) should not get the Pfizer vaccine, as it is one of the components.Anyone who had a severe allergic reaction after the first dose should not get the second dose of that vaccine.If you previously had an allergic reaction to a medication or vaccine, but are unsure what specific ingredient caused it, please speak to your healthcare practitioner before getting the vaccine. "

    {
        "Question": "some people get COVID-19 coronavirus two weeks after getting vaccine?",
        "Answer": "It takes at least two weeks for the body to develop immunity after getting the vaccine. You are only 'fully vaccinated' 30 days after getting the J&J vaccine or two weeks after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. If you are exposed to the virus before you are 'fully vaccinated', you may get the disease.Also, if you get COVID-19 within a few days after being vaccinated, it means you were already infected before getting the vaccine.The vaccine also does not completely prevent COVID-19 infection, even after you are 'fully vaccinated' but reduces the risk of severe COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation or death from COVID-19."

    {
        "Question": "vaccine cause COVID-19 coronavirus disease infection?",
        "Answer": "None of the vaccines used in South Africa contains the live virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccine can therefore not make you sick with COVID-19."

    {
        "Question": "Pfizer vaccine cause heart inflammation? safe give Pfizer vaccine to elderly?",
        "Answer": "In a very few cases, doctors found heart inflammation in young men who got the Pfizer vaccine. This is a very rare side effect, usually seen within two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. Common symptoms are chest pain, shortness of breath and an abnormal heartbeat (fast, pounding or fluttering). These symptoms are mostly mild and can be treated, followed by recovery shortly thereafter. People should therefore be aware of the symptoms and immediately seek medical help."

        "Question": "COVAX vaccines allocated different countries?",
        "Answer": "Once any of the COVAX vaccines have successfully undergone clinical trials and are proved to be both safe and effective, and have received regulatory approval, available doses will be allocated to all participating countries at the same rate, proportional to their total population size.No country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20 per cent of its population until all countries in the COVAX group have been offered this amount."
    },
    {
        "Question": "South Africa receive COVAX vaccines?",
        "Answer": "Yes. In his address to the nation on Monday, 14 December 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that South Africa is set to receive initial vaccines from the COVAX facility to cover 10 per cent of our population in the early part of 2021."
    },
    {
        "Question": "financing options available to South Africa COVAX Facility?",
        "Answer": "The COVAX Facility offered self-financing countries two different options to participate in. In the “committed purchase” option, participating countries make a lower upfront payment, but need to make firm guarantees to procure doses from the facility without the option to opt-out of specific candidates. In the “optional purchase” option, participating countries make a larger upfront payment, but can opt-out of vaccine allocations while they still reserve the option for later vaccines.In order to gain access to vaccines rapidly, South Africa agreed to participate in the “committed purchase” option of the COVAX Facility to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of South Africa’s population."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What else South Africa doing to get vaccines?",
        "Answer": "In addition to the COVAX vaccine, South Africa is also part of the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team that is looking at alternative financing mechanisms to secure additional vaccines for African countries beyond COVAX.Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, is part of this task team and is also looking at innovative partnerships with the private sector to ensure that South Africans have access to an effective vaccine that is suitable to local conditions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How much vaccine South Africa purchasing initially?",
        "Answer": "The Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccines (MAC) recommended that the commitment made by South Africa should be to purchase sufficient vaccines for 10 per cent of its population through the COVAX Facility. It also recommended continuing with the current ongoing bilateral discussions with vaccine manufacturers.Vaccination, even with the limited initial allocation, could be used to immunise front-line healthcare workers who are of critical importance to both manage COVID-19 patients and to sustain all aspects of health service delivery.Partial coverage of the population with a vaccine combined with non-pharmaceutical interventions, would significantly contribute to achieving a herd immunity threshold, thus protecting the population against forthcoming future waves of COVID."
    },
    {
        "Question": "South Africa not procure vaccines directly from manufacturers?",
        "Answer": "South Africa was approached directly by vaccine manufacturers to consider bilateral purchasing agreements. However, the risk with these arrangements was that price negotiations were confidential; up-front payments could have been lost should the vaccine not have proved safe and efficacious; and South Africa would have been limited to only a few vaccines through this mechanism and could have run the risk of not having a vaccine if these candidates were not successfully licensed."
    },
    {
        "Question": "South Africa make sure vaccines safe?",
        "Answer": "The Department of Health will work with the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) to ensure that whichever vaccine being recommended or made available through the COVAX Facility has met all the regulatory requires of safety, efficacy, and quality."
    },
    {
        "Question": "COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines approved before used in South Africa?",
        "Answer": "Yes. Before a vaccine can be rolled out the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) must assess the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine. SAHPRA has committed to ensuring the expeditious evaluation of these vaccines once they have been received, through various mechanisms that will shorten the timeframe it usually takes to approve a product."

    {
        "Question": "long term wearing of masks negative impact on one’s health?",
        "Answer": "Prolonged use of any face mask has not been shown to cause carbon dioxide toxicity or lack of adequate oxygen in healthy people. Healthcare workers routinely wear masks for prolonged periods while performing their duties.Cloth masks provide an additional layer of protection by reducing the number of microorganisms that a person releases into the air. Mass mask wearing will ensure that fewer potential viral droplets are released into the air.Wearing amask reduces the risk that someone will be exposed to the virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines unsafe normal safety protocols circumvented to fast track authorisation for use?",
        "Answer": "The fast development and approval of vaccines is a great human feat worthy of celebration. It this has been possible because we have learnt over many decades how to make and test vaccines and we were able to take those lessons and challenge ourselves to produce a vaccine much quicker.No step in the development, testing or ratification of the COVID-19 vaccines has been skipped. The world was able to develop vaccines fast because scientists and governments around the world collaborated in a manner that has never been achieved before and pooled resources and information to ensure that everyone can contribute to the knowledge. This allowed us to move much quicker than we have done before. The socio-economic devastation the virus is causing is what has motivated developers to move with urgency without compromising on quality standards."

    {
        "Question": "COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines alter recipient DNA.",
        "Answer": "Vaccines work by stimulating the body the same way the virus would if someone were infected.That means when you receive the vaccine the body then recognises that it looks like the coronavirus and then it releases certain chemicals that start a chain reaction to make immune cells that can fight the real virus.The vaccine does not work on the DNA of the body.Some people think that because some of the vaccines are made using RNA technology that means the RNA will interact with the DNA - that is not how it works. The technology is simply the way the vaccine is made - not what it will do to the body."
    },
    {
        "Question": "COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines microchip track and control an individual.",
        "Answer": "There is no vaccine microchip and there is no evidence to support claims that such a move is planned. Receiving a vaccine will not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Big business COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines improve profits.",
        "Answer": "The COVID-19 crisis has caused massive upheaval across the globe and no nation has been spared. A vaccine represents the best hope to save lives and to restore our way of life; many governments have therefore entered into direct talks with vaccine makers to ensure a timeous supply of vaccines."

    {
        "Question": "5G networks COVID-19 coronavirus radiation emissions.",
        "Answer": "The World Health Organisation has made it clear that viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. It is also a fact that COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose."

    {
        "Question": "The Vaccines have the mark of the Beast – 666. Vaccines are from the devil and are satanic",
        "Answer": "Vaccines are made to save lives and are made by technology. They have no connection with any religious organisations and cannot be infused with spirits, demons or other abstract ingredients. There is no conspiracy to possess, bewitch or control anybody."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Bill Gates COVID-19 coronavirus vaccines control the world.",
        "Answer": "Bill Gates, through his foundation with his wife The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have joined thousands of other organisations worldwide to help combat COVID-19. As government we are always careful to work together with organisations and people that share our ideals and aspirations for South African people. Our sovereignty and our people will never be compromised even as we work together with various entities all over the world."

    {
        "Question": "Vaccines way for former oppressors oppress us again.",
        "Answer": "The devastation of colonialisation and apartheid is still very much alive in the consciousness of our leaders and our people - government would never allow a situation where any country or nation would be allowed to oppress our people through any means.Scientists and governments all over the world, including our own, have contributed to the knowledge that has led to the development of the vaccines. It has not just been the work of Western and rich countries but a global collaboration.Vaccines are a way of liberating all of us from the socioeconomic devastation of COVID-19, which we have all suffered globally."
