        "Question": "What is COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is self-isolation?",
     "Answer": "Self-isolation is a way to keep yourself from possibly infecting others if you think you might be infected. It involves limiting contact with public places, relatives, friends, colleagues, and public transport."
    },
    {
     "Question": "How does the virus spread?",
     "Answer": "COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Hand washing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?",
     "Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is contact tracing?",
     "Answer": "Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases. Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing?",
     "Answer": "If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with that they might have been exposed to COVID-19."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Who is considered a close contact of someone with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period (for example, three individual 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes)."
    },
    {
     "Question": "If I am a close contact, will I be tested for COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should be tested, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I go to work having been in close contact with someone with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Anyone who is sick or displaying symptoms should not go to school or work. If you have been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, you should self-isolate for 14 days from the date of close contact. If you are concerned, contact your medical practitioner for further advice."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is community spread?",
     "Answer": "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)? ",
     "Answer": "Multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious condition associated with COVID-19 where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. "
    },
    {
     "Question": "If I have COVID-19, how do I tell people that I was around them?",
     "Answer": "If you have COVID-19, tell your close contacts you have COVID-19 so that they can quarantine at home and get tested. By letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to COVID-19, you are helping to protect them and others within your community."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Does mask use help determine if someone is considered a close contact?",
     "Answer": "A person is still considered a close contact even if one or both people wore a mask when they were together."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals? ",
     "Answer": "Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?",
     "Answer": "Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I use hand sanitizer on pets?",
     "Answer": "Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it's COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is community mitigation?",
     "Answer": "Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies."
    },
    {
     "Question": "what are the recommendations by the authorities",
