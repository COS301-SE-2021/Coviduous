        "Question": "What is COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people experience post-COVID conditions."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is self-isolation?",
     "Answer": "Self-isolation is a way to keep yourself from possibly infecting others if you think you might be infected. It involves limiting contact with public places, relatives, friends, colleagues, and public transport."
    },
    {
     "Question": "How does the virus spread?",
     "Answer": "COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Hand washing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?",
     "Answer": "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is contact tracing?",
     "Answer": "Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases. Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What will happen with my personal information during contact tracing?",
     "Answer": "If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with that they might have been exposed to COVID-19."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Who is considered a close contact of someone with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period (for example, three individual 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes)."
    },
    {
     "Question": "If I am a close contact, will I be tested for COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "If you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, you should be tested, even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I go to work having been in close contact with someone with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Anyone who is sick or displaying symptoms should not go to school or work. If you have been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, you should self-isolate for 14 days from the date of close contact. If you are concerned, contact your medical practitioner for further advice."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is community spread?",
     "Answer": "Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)? ",
     "Answer": "Multi system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious condition associated with COVID-19 where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others. "
    },
    {
     "Question": "If I have COVID-19, how do I tell people that I was around them?",
     "Answer": "If you have COVID-19, tell your close contacts you have COVID-19 so that they can quarantine at home and get tested. By letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to COVID-19, you are helping to protect them and others within your community."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Does mask use help determine if someone is considered a close contact?",
     "Answer": "A person is still considered a close contact even if one or both people wore a mask when they were together."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals? ",
     "Answer": "Based on the available information to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?",
     "Answer": "Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets."
    },
    {
     "Question": "Can I use hand sanitizer on pets?",
     "Answer": "Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it's COVID-19?",
     "Answer": "Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets."
    },
    {
     "Question": "What is community mitigation?",
     "Answer": "Community mitigation is a set of actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. The goal of community mitigation in areas with local COVID-19 transmission is to slow its spread and to protect all individuals, especially those at increased risk for severe illness, while minimizing the negative impacts of these strategies."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What happens to people who get COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?",
        "Answer": "Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should I get a test for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?",
        "Answer": "Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is isolation?",
        "Answer": "Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is quarantine?",
        "Answer": "Quarantine is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do I need to retest before returning to work?",
        "Answer": "At present, re-testing people who have experienced mild illness, and have recovered from COVID-19 is not recommended. A person is considered safe to return to the workplace and discontinue self-isolation if they are no longer infectious. This means they developed their first symptoms more than 10 days prior and have not experienced any symptoms for at least 3 days (72 hours)."
    }, #30
    {
        "Question": "Is it a fact that after 10 days you can't transfer the virus anymore?",
        "Answer": "The most infectious period is thought to be 1 to 3 days before symptoms start, and in the first 7 days after symptoms begin. But some people may remain infectious for longer and this is because typically with viruses, the higher the viral load (the more virus circulating in the body), the higher the risk of transmission through known transmission pathways. So the more severe the illness and the higher the viral load, the longer you continue to shed the virus and are infectious."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should’nt I be tested negative first before returning to work?",
        "Answer": "People who have been self-quarantining, because they had contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and have completed their 10-day quarantine period without developing symptoms, can return to work on day 11. There is no requirement to be tested prior to returning to the work. It is, however, recommended they continue to practice social distancing and good hygiene as a precaution and wear a surgical mask."
    },
    {
        "Question": "My colleague tested positive for COVID-19, what must I do?",
        "Answer": "If you work closely in the same environment as a person with COVID-19, you will need to self-quarantine for 10 days because you have had high-risk exposure. High-risk exposure means you have had direct, close contact for more than 15 minutes with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, and you did not wear protective cloth face masks or you had physical contact or took other risks that could have exposed you to the COVID-19 virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What must I do if I have tested negative but the symptoms are still there?",
        "Answer": "A patient can have a false negative if they have very little virus up there or perhaps the specimen was taken inappropriately. It didn’t get up high enough to actually get to the place where the virus was located. If a patient presents with symptoms of COVID-19 — cough, fever, shortness of breath — but they test negative, they should consult their health practitioner for further assessment."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What role do masks play in the prevention of COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Masks may help prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by stopping the spread of respiratory droplets when people talk, sneeze or cough."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does a mask replace other prevention methods, like washing hands?",
        "Answer": "No, the 5 golden rules should be always be followed: wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water; do not touch your face with unwashed hands; cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue; keep 1,5 metres apart from other people (social distancing); stay at home if you are unwell."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When should I use a cloth mask?",
        "Answer": "Cloth masks can be used when you are out in public. Like when you are travelling to work on public transport or doing shopping."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do I put the mask on and take it off?",
        "Answer": "Before putting on the mask: wash or sanitize your hands, place the mask against your face making sure it covers your nose and mouth. When wearing the mask: do not touch your face, do not fiddle with the mask, do not touch the mask with your hands,  remove the mask if it is damp or wet. When removing the mask: only touch the straps to remove the mask away from your face, put the mask in a container until you wash it or wash it immediately, wash or sanitize your hands after removing the mask. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I wear the same mask all day every day?",
        "Answer": "No, you will need 2 masks so that you can wash one and wear one. Wash your mask daily with soap and hot water. The mask is best dried in the sun and ironed. Do not share your mask with anyone."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do I have to wear a mask when I travel?",
        "Answer": "Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of a country."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can I protect myself from COVID-19 when using different types of transportation?",
        "Answer": "Maintaining physical distance to prevent COVID-19 is often difficult on public transportation conveyances. People may not be able to distance themselves by the recommended minimum of 6 feet from other people seated nearby or those standing in or passing through the aisles on airplanes, trains, or buses."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can travelling to visit family and friends increase my chances of getting and spreading COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes. CDC recommends delaying travel until you are fully vaccinated, because travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How long does it take to develop symptoms?",
        "Answer": "The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes. The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered is updated on a daily basis. At least 13 different vaccines (across 4 platforms) have been administered. Campaigns have started in 206 economies."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?",
        "Answer": "If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there treatments for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19. Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can adolescents catch COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19. While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, so far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been reported."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can adolescents spread COVID-19 to other people even if they have mild or no symptoms?",
        "Answer": "Yes. Infected people in all age groups – including adolescents - can transmit the virus to other people, even if they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill. The virus is spread from person to person through liquid particles such as aerosols (smaller) and droplets (larger) from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if someone in my family gets really ill with COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Immediately seek medical care if a member of your family gets seriously ill, for example develops difficulty breathing or feels pain or pressure in the chest. If possible, either you or an adult should contact your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out where and how you could get care."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if some of my friends are not sticking to the rules about physical distancing?",
        "Answer": "Explain to your friends why it is important to protect themselves and others by washing their hands, avoiding touching their face, always coughing or sneezing into their elbow, sleeve, or a tissue, and cooperating with physical distancing measures and movement restrictions when called on to do so. Maybe you can share ideas for fun virtual activities that your friends can participate in, and you can encourage them to do them together with you or with other friends."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I know there is a risk of getting COVID-19, but can I still play sports?",
        "Answer": "Yes. You can play sports that are in line with the physical distancing measures and movement restrictions that are in place in your country. If you are able to go for a bicycle ride, or if you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Schools are reopening in some areas of my country. Is it safe to  go back to school?",
        "Answer": "A decision to reopen schools in every country and area is made based on careful assessment of the situation, with consensus among all the key parties involved, including the health and education policy-makers, teachers and other school staff, parents and health and community workers. In addition, reopening of schools is carefully planned and prepared, with all necessary measures in place to protect the safety and health of everyone in the school community."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What should I do if I missed out on my education due to the COVID-19 pandemic?",
        "Answer": "Your school or place where you are studying are likely to make arrangements for you to catch up on what you have missed when your school was closed. Many schools have put in place accelerated learning modalities to help pupils catch up on learning loss. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should I wear a mask at school or when playing sports?",
        "Answer": "You should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise your breathing. However, remember to maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, limit the number of friends playing together, and respect hand hygiene."
    },
    {
        "Question": "When will this pandemic end so things can go back to normal?",
        "Answer": "We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends on every person’s contribution in helping stop the spread of the virus. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and by not going to school for a while, and other activities, are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through our communities."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What can we do so that other diseases like COVID-19 do not affect us in future?",
        "Answer": "To prevent the disastrous effects of emerging infectious diseases, we have to recognize that human health is intimately connected to the health of animals and our shared environment, and take action. Millions of young people have already mobilized to demand action not only on climate and biodiversity - but also for the right to breathe clean air, and for their future on a liveable planet."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is vaccination?",
        "Answer": "Vaccination is a safe and simple way to strengthen the immune system to build resistance against disease-causing germs. Once vaccinated, an individual will have a level of protection (or immunity), against that specific harmful disease. Vaccines contain a part of the virus/bacteria in a weakened, live or killed state, which will trigger a response from the immune system. It is important to be aware that vaccines do not cause disease or health complications."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How do vaccines work?",
        "Answer": "A vaccine trains your immune system to recognise and combat viruses/bacteria. When exposed, antibodies are naturally produced by the immune system to fight the disease. If the bacteria or virus reappears, the immune system will remember how to respond and quickly destroy it."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How are vaccines administered?",
        "Answer": "Vaccines are mostly given through injection, but some are administered orally (by mouth) or sprayed into the nasal cavities."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why is vaccination important?",
        "Answer": "Simply put, vaccination prevents disease and saves lives. It is a safe and effective way to protect oneself and those around you. Some individuals, for instance, those who suffer from a serious illness, are unable to take certain vaccines. These individuals depend on others to get vaccinated to reduce the spread of disease. Regular vaccination is needed to keep children healthy, prevent outbreaks and to eventually eradicate infectious diseases altogether."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why should I get vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "The reason is simple; if you get sick you could spread the disease to friends, family, and those most vulnerable around you."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there are multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Certain vaccines from some countries’ regulatory authorities have been approved for use and many more COVID-19 vaccines are currently being developed. Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective, the World Health Organization (WHO) collaborates with global partners to ensure equal access to COVID-19 vaccines for the billions of people who will need it. Most COVID-19 vaccines being tested or reviewed require two doses."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should I get tested for COVID-19 before taking the vaccine?",
        "Answer": "No, you don’t need to test for COVID-19 infection before receiving the vaccine. If a person is feeling sick or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, it is better to wait for 30-days after recovery, or after a 10-day quarantine period has been completed."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can I become resistant to the virus and its effects after having had it once?",
        "Answer": "Yes, a person can have good protection following a single infection. Immune responses are variable and some people develop better immunity than others. A person’s immunity is boosted every time they are exposed to the virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "If I had a confirmed COVID-19 infection, should I be vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "Yes. There is good evidence to show that persons who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after infection will develop stronger immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination. Evidence has shown that some people with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 do not develop strong antibody responses. Therefore vaccination after COVID-19 infection is a way to strengthen our immune responses and further reduce our chances of getting COVID-19."
    },
    {
        "Question": "I have just recovered from COVID-19, should I be vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "You should wait a minimum of 30 days after recovery to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Can a SARS-COV-2 vaccine actually give me COVID-19 infection?",
        "Answer": "No. When a COVID-19 vaccine is injected into the shoulder muscle, the vaccine contains only a small part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ‘spike protein gene’. This piece of the gene cannot replicate (grow) on its own, nor can it cause damage to the lungs that an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes. It is biologically impossible for a vaccine to give a person COVID-19 infection."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Why should you wait for 30-days post-COVID-19 recovery to be vaccinated?",
        "Answer": "The natural immune response to COVID-19 will be boosted through vaccination. Having at least 30-days between infection and vaccination would lead to an enhanced boosting of immunity."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do vaccines work from the first dose or do you need to get both?",
        "Answer": "The vaccine will start to work about two weeks after the first dose. And a person will get maximum protection following full vaccination, in other words, both doses."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are COVID-19 vaccines safe?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 vaccines are developed following the same legal requirements for quality, safety and efficacy as for all other vaccines. Like all vaccines, the effects of COVID-19 vaccines are tested first in the laboratory, including in animals, and then in human volunteers. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) evaluates COVID-19 vaccines against the same high standards as for all other vaccines before they are released for use."

    {
        "Question": "Are COVID-19 vaccines effective?",
        "Answer": "COVID-19 vaccines are developed and authorised for use following the same legal requirements and high standards for quality, safety and efficacy as for all other vaccines. Prior to marketing authorisation, vaccine efficacy is assessed in clinical trials, establishing how well the vaccine works in preventing COVID-19 disease of any severity. Benefits of a vaccine may include preventing the disease in the first place, a reduction of the number of people infected, the number of severe cases of a disease as well as the number of deaths, and the severity of the disease if contracted."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Do vaccinated individuals still need to follow personal protective measures?",
        "Answer": "At the early stages of vaccination campaigns it is not fully known to what extent fully vaccinated individuals will be protected from the disease in real-life conditions, how long they will be protected for, and what effect the vaccines will have on transmission. COVID-19 vaccines are proving to be effective at keeping people from becoming sick or seriously ill even if they do get COVID-19 disease. However, research is still ongoing on this topic, and more evidence is also needed about the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent transmission."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Will COVID-19 vaccines stop the pandemic?",
        "Answer": "Vaccines are a most powerful tool in ensuring public health, and COVID-19 vaccines can be expected to play an important role in contributing to control the pandemic. At this point, the pandemic is far from being over. In the first phases of vaccination campaigns, the main objective is to slow down the pandemic, protect those who are most at risk from severe disease, and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. More time is needed until a significant proportion of the EU population will have been vaccinated."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is COVID-19 vaccination still necessary, even after getting the disease and recovering?",
        "Answer": "Re-infection with COVID-19 occurs, although is relatively rare. Studies are ongoing, but at this point we do not know precisely how long people are naturally protected from getting COVID-19 again after clearing an infection. Early evidence suggests that such natural immunity from COVID-19 wanes over time and may not last very long. As a result, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended even for those who have recovered from the disease."

    {
        "Question": "Can COVID-19 be passed through breastfeeding?",
        "Answer": "Transmission of active COVID-19 (virus that can cause infection) through breast milk and breastfeeding has not been detected to date. There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is the risk of infection in pregnant women and newborn babies?",
        "Answer": "Existing data indicate that pregnant women who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 experience similar illness and symptoms to non-pregnant women. Pregnant women who have diabetes and/or are obese may experience more severe disease. A limited number of cases have been reported with good overall outcomes and no severe illness for the newborn. All pregnant women should follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick and self-isolating in the event of symptoms."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is there any treatment for COVID-19 disease?",
        "Answer": "The treatment for people who are hospitalised with severe COVID-19 disease is largely supportive (e.g. oxygen therapy, management of fluids), mostly using a symptomatic approach, targeting the symptoms rather than the virus."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How can I avoid infecting others?",
        "Answer": "If you have any symptoms that are compatible with COVID-19, you should stay home and follow local recommendations on contacting your healthcare provider for advice about testing, isolation from others and medical care. Cough or sneeze into your elbow, or into a tissue. If you use a tissue, dispose of it carefully after a single use. Ensure you regularly clean your hands."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What is physical distancing and why and how should I do it?",
        "Answer": "The term ‘physical distancing’ means the same as the widely-used term ‘social distancing’, but it more accurately describes what is intended, namely that people should keep a physical distance from one another. The success of physical distancing measures depends on ensuring that people maintain social contact from a distance with friends, family and colleagues. Internet-based communication and the phone are therefore key tools for ensuring a successful physical distancing strategy."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are face masks effective in protecting against COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "If you are infected, the use of medical face masks (generally pale blue in colour and available from pharmacies) may reduce the risk of you infecting others. Consider using a face mask when visiting busy, enclosed spaces where it is not possible to maintain sufficient physical distance from others, such as grocery stores and shopping centres, or when using public transport."
    }, 
    {
        "Question": "When and where should I be tested for COVID-19?",
        "Answer": "Anyone who develops symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested for the virus, wherever possible. Testing is also recommended, if possible, for people who do not have symptoms but who have been in close contact with a case of COVID-19. These tests are called ‘PCR’ (polymerase chain reaction) tests and are molecular tests that can detect the virus. They are usually conducted on samples collected from the throat or nose using a swab."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should children wear a mask?",
        "Answer": "Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What type of mask should children wear?",
        "Answer": "Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. This provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. The adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How should children wear a mask?",
        "Answer": "Children should be taught how to wear the mask properly, including not touching the front of the mask and not pulling it under the chin or into their mouth. They should store the mask in a bag or container, and not share the mask with others."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should a child wear a mask at home?",
        "Answer": "Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask, as long as they can tolerate it. The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should teachers or other adults working with children wear a mask?",
        "Answer": "In areas where there is widespread transmission, all adults under the age of 60 and who are in general good health should wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others. This is particularly important for adults working with children who may have close contact with children and one another."
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should children wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities?",
        "Answer": "Children should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise their breathing. When organizing these activities for children, it is important to encourage all other critical public health measures: maintaining at least a 1-metre distance from others, limiting the number of children playing together, providing access to hand hygiene facilities and encouraging their use. "
    },
    {
        "Question": "Are there alternatives to fabric masks such as face shields?",
        "Answer": "In the context of COVID-19, some children may not be able to wear a mask due to disabilities or specific situations such as speech classes where the teacher needs to see their mouths. In these cases, face shields may be considered an alternative to masks, but they do not provide the equivalent protection in keeping the virus from being transmitted to others."
    },
    {
        "Question": "What are the recommended practices once back home after outdoor activities?",
        "Answer": "Thorough hand hygiene: washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand gel, should be performed before touching surfaces, items, pets, and people within the household environment."
    },
    {
        "Question": "How should I clean food items from the grocery store or packaged items?",
        "Answer": "There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply. The COVID-19 virus is generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of the COVID-19 virus associated with food."
